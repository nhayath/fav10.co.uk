## Nike Air VaporMax Flyknit 3

Air VaporMax dawns a new chapter in Nike innovation. The new state of the art VaporMax technology keeps a spring in your feet with toe-to-heel cushioning. To give you a genuine feeling of "running on air", the designers have formulated a new structure where the Air unit is attached directly to the upper. With this new design when you take a step down, each lug gets pushed into the Air unit, ramping up the pressure. Then, as you step off, the conserved pressure is then released resulting in a springy bounce with superior flexibility. Made for runners, the futuristic technology was quickly adopted by the street, bringing this light-as-air feeling to the masses.

<br />

## Features

<br />

- VaporMax Air technology provides springy bounces with superior flexibility.
- Flyknit construction perfectly combines breathability, stretch and support.
- Textured 2-tone upper design
- Flywire cables work seamlessly with the laces to provide more support
- Revolutionary restructuring creates contoured cushioning that sits directly underfoot and flexes with your stride.
- Skin overlay on the centre of the heel features a linear "VAPORMAX" logo.
- Tongue label takes inspiration from patches on Apollo spacesuits.
- Integrated lugs across the outsole create bouncy traction.
- Rubber pods in high-wear areas enhance durability.
